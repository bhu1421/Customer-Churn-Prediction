## Customer-Churn-Prediction

###  Project Overview

This project focuses on **predicting customer churn** using machine learning and simple deep learning models. Customer churn refers to customers who stop using a company’s service or product. Predicting churn helps businesses take proactive steps to retain customers.

The project includes:

* Data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
* Multiple ML classification models
* A simple Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model
* Model evaluation and comparison

###  Dataset Description

The dataset contains customer-related features such as:

* Demographic details (e.g., gender, age)
* Service usage details
* Billing information
* Target variable: **Churn** (Yes/No)

> File format: `.xls` (Excel)
